# Mark SJ's Cloud Resume.

Hi folks, this is my cloud resume built on AWS. It's a static website stored on S3 with a visitor counter built using Lambda. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've excluded IaaC for now.

## Services used:
+ S3
+ CloudFront
+ Certificate Manager
+ Lambda
+ IAM
+ Dynamo DB
+ GitHub Actions
