Mark SJ's Cloud Resume.

This is my take on the cloud resume challenge built on AWS. It's a static website stored on S3 with a visitor counter built using Lambda. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've excluded IaaC for now.

Services used:
S3
DynamoDB
Lambda
Route53 
ACM
CICD
Github Actions
